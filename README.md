## Project Description
This project implements a full 3D scene reconstruction pipeline from scratch using multi-view images captured with a smartphone. The goal is to reconstruct a sparse point cloud of a scene using feature detection, pose estimation, triangulation, and bundle adjustment in C++. Dense reconstruction was also explored using MiDaS depth estimation.
